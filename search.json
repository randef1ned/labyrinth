From human memory to activation diffusion network","title":"Introduction and inspirations of labyrinth","text":"Memory fundamental cognitive process allows brain store, acquire, recall information. serves temporary storage system sensory cues disappear (Benjamin 2007). Memory plays crucial role encoding, storing, retaining, recalling everything simple sensory data complex knowledge experiences. Additionally, memory basis learning, planning, decision-making (Benjamin 2007; Nussenbaum, Prentis, Hartley 2020). Specifically, enables us learn past experiences simulate potential future outcomes, thereby influencing current behavior future actions (Schacter et al. 2012). formation memories, recall, reasoning based involve combination systems physiological processes allow humans adapt well environment (Schacter et al. 2012; Camina Güell 2017; Nairne Pandeirada 2016).Memory formation comprises three stages: information perception, encoding, storage (Atkinson Shiffrin 1968). stages correspond three types memory: (1) sensory memory (Atkinson Shiffrin 1968) briefly stores raw physical stimuli primary receptors vision hearing; (2) short-term memory (STM) (Baddeley 2000) involves transient storage manipulation information, allowing individuals temporarily memorize small amounts data perform current future tasks; (3) long-term memory (LTM) (Camina Güell 2017) long-term storage information, divided episodic implicit memory. Episodic memory consists knowledge processed recalled conscious level, personal experiences specialized knowledge, implicit memory encompasses skills habits expressed without conscious awareness, fear, riding bicycle, heart rate regulation, conditioned reflexes (Smith Grossman 2008). contrast limited-capacity sensory memory STM, LTM complex cognitive system unlimited capacity long-term storage retrieval wide range information, including factual knowledge personal experiences. Memory can also categorized contextual memory, referring individual’s personal experiences, semantic memory, referring textual knowledge concepts (Renoult et al. 2019). Storing contextual semantic knowledge allows individuals construct new knowledge based past experiences, facilitating survival (Kazanas Altarriba 2015). addition storing information memories, LTM plays important role learning reasoning. can automatically relate relationships attributes objects (Nairne Pandeirada 2016), giving individuals ability use stored skills concepts make rational decisions evaluating different choices various environments predicting possible outcomes (Camina Güell 2017). formation consolidation LTM involve several brain regions, including prefrontal lobe, associated working memory situational memory LTM (Blumenfeld Ranganath 2019), temporal lobe, associated semantic memory LTM (Simmons Martin 2009). hippocampus acts relay station information (Squire Zola-Morgan 1991) can integrate situational memory semantic memory knowledge network stored LTM (Renoult et al. 2019). Consequently, even concept knowledge, knowledge network formed different individuals can vary. individual unique experiences backgrounds, leading different understandings reactions interpreting information. LTM stored vast complex semantic network, includes various types interconnected nodes, concepts, memories, experiences (Collins Loftus 1975). kinds memories experiences also integrated network; example, individual’s representation abstract concepts (e.g., time) may based physical sensations (Casasanto Boroditsky 2008). cases, individuals associate time experiences, forming knowledge network. form organization named semantic networks knowledge networks, emphasizing information interconnected organized according meaning (Lehmann 1992). article, use term semantic network represent form memory storage organization LTM, knowledge network refers artificially built knowledge network. semantic network, concepts represented nodes, concept--concept relationships represented edges nodes, edge weights indicating strength association. higher edge weight implies closer relationship two nodes, typically resulting higher recall rate receiving stimulus (Anderson 1983). Learning memorizing new knowledge experiences involve building new edges reinforcing existing ones. organization facilitates information retrieval enabling individuals jump one concept another network simultaneously activate neighboring nodes form knowledge connections, even direct correlation (Lehmann 1992). interesting example semantic network police officers, black people produce strong association weapons, association even stronger police officer sleep-deprived (James 2018). Another example individual’s preference Coca-Cola McDonald’s determined attitude reflected semantic network (Lee Kim 2013; Karpinski, Steinman, Hilton 2005). Homogeneous networks consist nodes similar properties characteristics (Mhatre Rosenberg 2004). Nodes represented kind elements edges connected nodes high correlations, jointly creating homogeneous network. two examples mentioned illustrate different individuals form different LTMs, memory contents stored LTMs satisfy homogeneity. Moving one concept unrelated concept impossible homogeneous network. process individuals store memories semantic network retrieve information LTM often described spreading activation, network also called spreading activation network (Sharifian Samani 1997). network model, initial node activated, activation state spreads nodes along connected edges. diffusion process can quickly span multiple network layers, extensively activating concepts memories associated initial node. node receives activation certain threshold, fully activated like neurons. Otherwise, activated. may lead recall specific memories, formation decisions, generation problem-solving strategies. mentioned earlier, unrelated concepts semantic network may relatively strong associations. implicit association test (IAT) paradigm proposed Greenwald can effectively test edge connections nodes individual semantic network (Greenwald, McGhee, Schwartz 1998; Greenwald et al. 2009). paradigm tests strength association human brain two nodes, .e., edge weights. mechanisms association activation activation diffusion networks depend strength association nodes. strength high, probability activation relatively high; strength low, higher probability non-activation. theory partly explains forgetting phenomenon occurs human memory. Additionally, activation diffusion networks enable individuals retrieve necessary information, reorganize memories, apply knowledge different situations. summary, activation diffusion networks effectively account dynamic nature memory retrieval use.","code":""},{"path":"https://labyrinth.yinchun.su/articles/preface.html","id":"unique-advantages-of-human-cognitive-abilities","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"2. Unique advantages of human cognitive abilities","title":"Introduction and inspirations of labyrinth","text":"Compared computer programs, humans possess ability think problems different perspectives exhibit greater flexibility knowledge association (Lehmann 1992). Therefore, humans advantage applying knowledge one domain another seemingly unrelated domain. example, concepts biology can transferred economics (Lawlor et al. 2008), economic models field electronic information (Han et al. 2019), linguistic concepts neuroscience (Mayberry et al. 2018) computer science (H. Zhang et al. 2023). characteristic led humans create many cross-disciplinary fields, artificial intelligence, computational biology, neuropolitics, bioinformatics. Humans can use intuition creative thinking solve problems, ability think across domains allows make new connections different areas, thereby building new disciplinary knowledge. human brain contains approximately 100 billion neurons roughly number glial cells (Bartheld, Bahney, Herculano-Houzel 2016), connected thousands others via synapses (Herculano-Houzel 2009). Neurons glial cells form extremely complex networks. Neurons communicate via --none principle (Pareti 2007), glial cells play crucial roles central nervous system formation, neuronal differentiation, synapse formation (Allen Lyons 2018), regulation neuroinflammatory immunity (Yang Zhou 2019), neurological diseases like dementia (Kim, Choi, Yoon 2020), addition traditional supportive functions (Wolosker et al. 2008). complexity lays foundation individual’s ability process information, experience emotions, maintain awareness, exhibit creativity. Drawing fundamentals human cognition, artificial neural networks simulated using computers mimic brain’s information processing. emulate human cognitive abilities extent, excelling tasks like learning, decision-making, pattern recognition humans naturally proficient (Agatonovic-Kustrin Beresford 2000; Parisi 1997). simulation human cognitive abilities shown great potential (Parisi 1997; Zahedi 1991). However, neurons used deep learning artificial neural networks highly abstract, architecture unable account neurons (Cichy Kaiser 2019). Therefore, field focused attention fitting data rather interpreting (Pichler Hartig 2023). Currently, field deep learning concerned fitting data, effect fitting used guiding criterion field, rather integrating cognitive mechanisms discovered neuroscience (Chavlis Poirazi 2021). Much progress deep learning recent decades can attributed application backpropagation, often used optimization methods update weights minimize loss function. However, neural networks deep learning biologically inspired approaches, biological rationality backpropagation remains questionable, activated neurons acquire features backpropagation (Whittington Bogacz 2019; Lillicrap et al. 2020; Aru, Suzuki, Larkum 2020). Currently, two mainstream learning mechanisms identified human brain using electrophysiological methods: Hebbian learning (Munakata Pfaffly 2004) reinforcement learning (Botvinick et al. 2019). Additionally, synaptic pruning may related learning (Halassa Haydon 2010), epigenetic mechanisms also play important role (Changeux, Courrège, Danchin 1973). Although Hebbian learning, reinforcement learning, attempts migrate human cognitive mechanisms applied deep learning years, still perfectly reproduce human learning features (Volzhenin, Changeux, Dumas 2022). Comparatively, energy consumption using neural networks reasoning huge (Desislavov, Martínez-Plumed, Hernández-Orallo 2023), contrast human brain’s lower energy usage training reasoning (Attwell Laughlin 2001). Another example attention mechanism neural networks, inspired human attention (Vaswani et al. 2023). Attention cognitive ability selectively receives information limited resources (Nelson Cowan et al. 2005). ’s complex biological process involving multiple brain regions, encompassing selective attention also coordinated consciousness, memory, cognition. Selective attention mechanisms associated short-term memory, 3-5 chunks original stimuli can enter single session (N. Cowan 2001), attention lasting just seconds minutes (Polti, Martin, Van Wassenhove 2018). selective mechanism allows humans focus targets limited resources, reducing cognitive resource consumption (Buschman Kastner 2015), refining elements deposited memory (Chun Turk-Browne 2007), delimiting problem space, narrowing memory retrieval problem-solving situations (Wiley Jarosz 2012). Human intuition numbers may also relate attention (Kutter et al. 2023). Thus, selective attention crucial cognitive activities like perception, memory, decision-making. Attention mechanisms deep learning, inspired human selective attention, successfully integrated various frameworks (Niu, Zhong, Yu 2021), greatly improving performance tasks like natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, speech recognition (B. Zhang, Xiong, Su 2020; Guo et al. 2022; Ding et al. 2021). recent years, Transformer model, relying self-attention mechanisms process data, demonstrated superior performance across various tasks (Vaswani et al. 2023; Khan et al. 2022). multi-head attention mechanism performs multiple parallel self-attention computations different parameters, allowing model capture information different subspaces improving fitting efficiency accuracy (Liu, Liu, Han 2021). Practically, Transformer, neural networks made significant progress areas like NLP vision tasks. Attention mechanisms deep learning implemented mathematical functions assign weights different elements input data (Niu, Zhong, Yu 2021; De Santana Correia Colombini 2022). However, subset studies found attention mechanism deep learning fully simulate human attention lacks cognitive emotional context human attention encompasses (Lai et al. 2021). Despite differences, artificial neural networks successfully applied several fields, including image speech recognition, natural language processing, robot control, gaming, decision support systems. applications demonstrate power artificial neural networks dealing complex problems simulating certain human cognitive processes highlighting unique advantages models simulate human cognitive abilities.","code":""},{"path":"https://labyrinth.yinchun.su/articles/preface.html","id":"simulating-human-cognitive-abilities-the-way-forward","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"3.

Transformer’s attention model primarily applied self-attention multi-head attention mechanisms. self-attention mechanism considers elements sequence processing input element, enabling model capture long-range dependencies within sequence (Vig Belinkov 2019). element transformed query (q), key (k), value (v) vectors, representing current lexical element, lexical elements, information contained lexical element, respectively. attention score computed calculating similarity scores q k, weighted summing v. Recently, LLMs employed Transformer’s framework, demonstrating improved simulation human cognition. LLMs large-scale simulations human cognitive functions (Binz Schulz 2023), emergence mark significant advancement computers’ ability simulate human cognition. LLMs possess enhanced reasoning capabilities, Claude 3, released month Anthropic, exhibits self-awareness contextual understanding needle---haystack task (Anthropic 2024; Kuratov et al. 2024). zero-shot problem scenarios, LLMs’ reasoning abilities without prior knowledge surpass humans, rely analogies reasoning (Webb, Holyoak, Lu 2023). Furthermore, LLMs can comprehend others’ beliefs, goals, mental states accuracy 80%. Notably, GPT-4, considered advanced LLM, can achieve 100% accuracy theory mind (ToM) tasks suitable prompting, indicating human-like level ToM (Thaler 1988). LLMs can also simulate human behavior observed experiments, ultimatum game (Thaler 1988), garden-path sentences (Ferreira, Christianson, Hollingworth 2001), loss aversion (Kimball 1993), reactions Milgram electric shock experiment (Blass 1999; Aher, Arriaga, Kalai 2022). Additionally, LLMs exhibit cognitive biases errors humans typically demonstrate, additive bias (Winter et al. 2023), individuals default adding modifying existing content rather deleting pushing back problem-solving (Adams et al. 2021). LLMs produce various human cognitive effects, including priming effects biases (Koo et al. 2023; Shaki, Kraus, Wooldridge 2023), suggesting LLMs mimicking human cognitive processes may possess cognitive abilities approaching human level. specific domains, LLMs closely mimic human-specific abilities. instance, ChatGPT’s accuracy medical diagnosis providing feasible medical advice complex situations comparable human physicians (Hopkins et al. 2023). performance metrics show diagnoses 93.3% common clinical cases correctly (Hirosawa et al. 2023). Furthermore, standardized clinical decision-making tasks, ChatGPT achieves accuracy rate close 70% (Rao et al. 2023), similar expected level third-year medical students United States (Gilson et al. 2023). Due GPT-4’s superior ToM, correctly answered 90% soft skill questions (Brin et al. 2023), demonstrating excellent clinical skills. However, ChatGPT’s ability handle complex questions remains unsatisfactory compared widely used technologies like Google search (Hopkins et al. 2023). fully replicate professional clinicians’ decision-making abilities faced complex problems, primarily due text-based training data, resulting less satisfactory performance non-text-based tasks (Y. Zhang et al. 2024). Furthermore, patient care medically related domains, sometimes generates false misleading information, potentially causing doctors, nurses, caregivers make erroneous decisions, endangering patients’ lives (Z. Ji et al. 2023). LLMs often contain billions hundreds billions parameters, making difficult implement debugging understand decision-making processes (Z. Ji et al. 2023; Khullar, Wang, Wang 2024). Therefore, developing relatively interpretable models viable alternative moment. models trained specific areas expertise, possessing prior knowledge learning exclusively samples.

LLMs require enormous number parameters vast amount training data, consuming substantial computational resources training process (S. Zhang et al. 2022). Even training, reasoning LLMs consumes significant computational resources (Samsi et al. 2023). Furthermore, LLMs produce large carbon footprint (S. Zhang et al. 2022; Faiz et al. 2023) require considerable water consumption cooling (George, .S.Hovan George, .S.Gabrio Martin 2023), exacerbating environmental concerns extreme climate events. computational power concentrated labs, LLM also exacerbates inequality issues prevents labs gaining LLMs (S.

Recently, OpenAI demonstrated early forms artificial intelligence LLMs increasing parameters training sample size (OpenAI et al. 2023; Bubeck et al. 2023; Schaeffer, Miranda, Koyejo 2023; Wei et al. 2022), challenging many scholars’ perceptions. argued resembles Chinese room problem, LLMs emerge intelligence rather acquire deeper features language, consciousness may special form language (Hamid 2023). Others contend emergent intelligence LLMs merely wishful thinking researchers (Schaeffer, Miranda, Koyejo 2023). Alternatively, proposed LLMs resemble human societies, large number individuals collectively exhibit abilities individuals possess, emergent capabilities resulting complex relationships numerous data points, akin ant colony algorithms. suspect possible reasons emergence regarding capabilities demonstrated LLMs. noted earlier, developing relatively interpretable specialized models maximize usability transparency, making safer clinical applications. past decades, humans accumulated substantial historical experience fighting diseases large number low-practice-value papers monographs (Hanson et al. 2023).

Therefore, adapted original spreading activation model replacing LTM knowledge network substituting memory search inference random walk approach simulate human abilities. LLMs often trained using knowledge publications, promising life2vec model uses medical information Danish citizens. , use medical texts build knowledge networks train models. knowledge network large-scale, graph-structured database abstracts core concepts relationships reality, allowing AI systems understand complex relationships reason . can integrate various data sources types represent relationships elements properties. Knowledge networks abstract real world AI systems (Martin Baggio 2020), enabling solve complex tasks reason world (S. Ji et al. 2022). Biomedical knowledge characterized using formalism, abstraction process human brain model systems formally mathematically (Phillips 2020). Although biomedical knowledge use formulas describe biological processes like mathematics, physics, chemistry, knowledge networks can establish mechanisms involved biological processes (Martin Baggio 2020). example, biologists usually use nodes represent genes edges represent regulatory relationships genes. knowledge network constructed, can simulate humans utilize LTM choosing random walk approach. Numerous studies shown random walk can effectively simulate human semantic cognition (S. Ji et al. 2022; Kumar, Steyvers, Balota 2021) consistent human memory retrieval process. Compared outputs spreading activation, computer-simulated random walks showed higher correlation spreading activation model’s results (Abbott, Austerweil, Griffiths 2015; Zemla Austerweil 2018; Siew 2019). Furthermore, brain scientists used random walk algorithms explore theoretical concepts (Abbott, Austerweil, Griffiths 2015; Siew 2019) simulate specific human cognitive behaviors reduce experimental errors introduced external environments (Abbott, Austerweil, Griffiths 2015; Zemla Austerweil 2018).
