\details{
The labyrinth model is trained by integrating knowledge from two major
  sources: text-based information from medical corpora and biological
  knowledge from functional interaction networks.

For the text-based component, labyrinth:

1. Extracts drug information (nomenclature, targets, and indications) from
  databases like DrugBank, CTD, and ChEMBL.

2. Obtains clinical trial data from the Cochrane Library.

3. Mines co-occurrence patterns in published literature from the Web of
  Science corpus.

4. Preprocesses the text data from over 10 million publications, including
  stop word removal and term vectorization using Skip-gram models.

5. Quantifies structured drug-disease relationships based on clinical trial
  phases, citation analysis, and network proximity between gene sets.

For the biological component, labyrinth evaluates the network proximity
  between drug target modules and disease gene modules within a functional
  interactome network.

The text-based and biological knowledge matrices are then integrated through
  probabilistic computations, simulating the process of storing relevant
  knowledge in long-term memory for decision-making.
