\description{
A character vector containing Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) identifiers for

}
\details{
The `disease_ids` object is a character vector that contains MeSH identifiers
  (MeSH IDs) for various diseases. Each element in the vector represents a
  unique MeSH identifier, which can be used to identify and reference
  specific diseases in the MeSH taxonomy.

MeSH identifiers are hierarchically organized and provide a standardized way
  of representing and categorizing diseases and other medical concepts.
