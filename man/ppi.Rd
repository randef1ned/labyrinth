\title{Protein-protein interaction network}
\format{
A \code{\link[Matrix:dgCMatrix-class]{dgCMatrix}} object from the
  \code{\link[Matrix:Matrix]{Matrix}} package, where a value of 1 indicates
  a connection (interaction) between two genes, and 0 indicates no
  connection. The rows and columns of the matrix correspond to gene
  identifiers, and the matrix is square and symmetric, representing an
  undirected adjacency network.

\source{
The protein-protein interaction data was compiled from the following
  databases:
  \itemize{
    \item KEGG (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/)
    \item Reactome (https://reactome.org/)
    \item Biocarta (https://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways/BioCarta_Pathways)

\description{
A sparse adjacency matrix representing a protein-protein interaction network
  compiled from multiple databases.
}
\details{
The `ppi` data set is a sparse adjacency matrix representing a
  protein-protein interaction network. The network was compiled from seven
  databases: KEGG, Reactome, Biocarta, NCI, SPIKE, HumanCyc, and Panther.

The rows and columns of the matrix correspond to gene identifiers, and the
  order of the genes is consistent across rows and columns. The matrix is
  square and symmetric, representing an undirected network, where an
  interaction between gene A and gene B is represented by a 1 in both the
  (A, B) and (B, A) positions of the matrix.
