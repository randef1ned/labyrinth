\title{Protein-protein interaction network}
\format{
A \code{\link[Matrix:dgCMatrix-class]{dgCMatrix}} object from the 
  \code{\link[Matrix:Matrix]{Matrix}} package, where a value of 1 indicates
  a connection (interaction) between two genes, and 0 indicates no 
  connection. The rows and columns of the matrix correspond to gene 
  identifiers, and the matrix is square and symmetric, representing an 
  undirected adjacency network.

The protein-protein interaction data was compiled from the following databases:
  \itemize{
    \item KEGG (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/)

\description{
A sparse adjacency matrix representing a protein-protein interaction network
  compiled from multiple databases.
}
\details{
The `ppi` data set is a sparse adjacency matrix representing a 
  protein-protein interaction network. The network was compiled from seven 
  databases: KEGG, Reactome, Biocarta, NCI, SPIKE, HumanCyc, and Panther.

The rows and columns of the matrix correspond to gene identifiers, and the 
  order of the genes is consistent across rows and columns. The matrix is 
  square and symmetric, representing an undirected network, where an 
  interaction between gene A and gene B is represented by a 1 in both the 
  (A, B) and (B, A) positions of the matrix.

\examples{
library(Matrix)
data(ppi, package = "labyrinth")

# Access a specific element of the matrix
ppi[1, 2]  # Interaction between gene 1 and gene 2

# Convert to a dense matrix for visualization or analysis
dense_ppi <- as.matrix(ppi)
