//' Sigmoid function of Spreadgram - C++ version
//' 
//' @description
//' The Sigmoid function is one of the basic function in Spreadgram algorithm. 
//'   This function calculates the Sigmoid function of a specific node given the 
//'   activation rates of the nodes and its neighbors. 
//'   The equation writes
//'   \deqn{\sigma (x,y) = {{\exp [a(x)a(y)]} \over {1 + \exp [a(x)a(y)]}}}.
//' 
//' @param ax A vector of the activation rates of x, which is a set of the y's 
//'   neighbors
//' 
//' @param ay A scalar of the activation rate of node y.
//' 
//' @param u If \eqn{x \in N(y)} then \eqn{u = 1}, otherwise \eqn{u = 0}. 
//' 
//' @return A vector of sigma
//' 
//' @examples
//' sigmoid_t(c(1,2,3), 2)
